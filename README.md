# Audio Processing with Python

## Overview
This repository contains code, tutorials, and resources for a comprehensive audio processing course. The course covers everything from exploring audio datasets to advanced processing techniques, fine-tuning models, and pre-training audio models.

## Current Content
The repository currently includes:

1 - **ExploreAudio**: Basic exploration of audio datasets using the PolyAI/minds14 dataset
  - Loading and examining audio data
  - Visualizing audio waveforms
  - Audio preprocessing techniques
  - Working with feature extraction for machine learning
  - Handling large audio datasets with streaming mode

## What's Coming
This is an evolving course that will be progressively expanded with the following topics:
