# Audio Processing with Python

## Overview
This repository contains code, tutorials, and resources for a comprehensive audio processing course. The course covers everything from exploring audio datasets to advanced processing techniques, fine-tuning models, and pre-training audio models.

## Current Content
The repository currently includes:

### 1 - **ExploreAudio**: Basic exploration of audio datasets using the PolyAI/minds14 dataset
  - Loading and examining audio data
  - Visualizing audio waveforms
  - Audio preprocessing techniques
  - Working with feature extraction for machine learning
  - Handling large audio datasets with streaming mode
    
### 2- PreTrainedAudioModels: Working with pre-trained models for various audio tasks

- Audio classification using Hugging Face pipelines
- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) implementation
- Text-to-Speech generation techniques
- Controlling output parameters with max_tokens
- Working with specialized audio models (MusicGen)
- Passing additional parameters to audio pipelines
- Spectrogram visualization and analysis



This section builds nicely on the exploration covered in the first part, showing how to apply pre-trained models to the audio data you've learned to work with.
## What's Coming
This is an evolving course that will be progressively expanded with the following topics:
